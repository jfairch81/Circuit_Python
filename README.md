### CircuitPython Servo
#### Description
Make a servo turn one way when one wire is touched and turn the other when another wire is touched
#### What I Learned
I didn't know what capacitive touch was so this helped me, also I learned how to code for a servo in CircuitPython
### Hello CircuitPython
#### Description
Make an LED Fade in and out
#### What I Learned
This was my first assignment in Circuitpython so I got used to using "While True:" instead of the loop and not having to use semicolons
### CircuitPython LCD
#### Description
Use a Button to have a variable go up and print on an LCD, it would make the counter go down
#### What I Learned
I have already done this assignment before in Engineering 2 but It was a challenge in CircuitPython, having to import new libraries in the code to make the LCD work
### CircuitPython Photo Interrupters
#### Description
Without using time.sleep, have a Photo Interrupter register every 4 seconds how many times it has been interrupted
#### What I Learned
I have never not used a time variable so this was a challenge, I found something called time.monotonic which basically did the same thing as sleep except it needed more code
### CircuitPython Distance Sensors
#### Description
Use an HC-SR04 to make the rgb led on the Metro Express change colors in relation to the distance from the Sensor
#### What I Learned
I didn't know before what mapping was, so I had to research it and I learned what it was and I mapped the range from the HC-SR04 to the LED
### Hello Git
#### Description
Downloading Git Bash and make a ReadME.md, an introduction to GitHub
#### What I Learned
I had never used something like this before but when I finally got it downloaded I did the assignment, I looked up Github and it is what colleges use so I was skeptical at first but I think it will be very helpful
### Hello GitHub
#### Description
Create a Repository and put all assignments in it
#### What I Learned
I learned hwo to use Github and the Git Repository, I also found it helpful because I can edit code in Github
### Git - Forks and Clones
#### Description
Forking the CHS Sigma Github account and making my own part of it, Then making a local copy of the repository
#### What I Learned
This is when I started to really understand Github, I edited the ReadME for all of Engineering 3 so I am officially in it, and I learned how to get to other peoples repositories and the big CHS repository
### Hello VS Code
#### Description
Introduction to VS Code, print something in the serial monitor
#### What I Learned
I learned how to use VS code and that I need to use the Pylint error eraser everytime I import something
### Classes, Objects, and Module
#### Description
Made a library for RGB LED and coded in one and the Main.py ran it in another tab
#### What I Learned
I leanred how to make a library and how to code for an RGB LED because I had never used one before. I also learned how to use an init statement
### FancyLED
#### Description
Have 6 LEDs and make your own library and have the LED's do different tasks 
#### What I Learned
I used my knowledge from Classes, Objects, and Module to make this assignment, I had trouble getting the LEDs to turn on using the variables I made but from there on it was easy
